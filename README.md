  Based in Edmonton, Canada with work experience as a digital artist, I am excited about the opportunity to bring my skills and creativity as front-end web developer.

  In addition to my background in digital art, I have recently upgraded
my skillset to include web design and development. I am now seeking
work where I can use my web design and development skills to create engaging and
user-friendly websites.

  I am confident that my combination of artistic talent and technical
expertise makes me a strong candidate for this role. I am eager to
contribute as part of a team or independently, and help drive the success of your web projects.

  Thank you for visiting.
