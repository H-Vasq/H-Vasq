I am a digital artist turned web developer who loves creating engaging and user-friendly websites. Based in Edmonton, Canada, I have a strong background in digital art and a passion for web design and development. I am always eager to learn new skills and technologies to enhance my web development portfolio.

Whether working as part of a team or independently, I can deliver high-quality web projects that meet your needs and expectations. I have experience in using various web development tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB and more.

I am excited about the opportunity to join your company as a front-end web developer and bring my skills and creativity to your web projects. Thank you for visiting and considering my qualifications.
